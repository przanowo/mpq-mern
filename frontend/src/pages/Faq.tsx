      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <p>
        Vintage perfumes can be anywhere from 20 to 60 years old. Their scents
        are more mature, but they can also degrade. If the scent doesn't meet
        your expectations, I'm always open to exchanges within 7 days. I believe
        this is important. However, to ensure longevity, we recommend storing
        them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.

        Do you offer samples? Yes! We offer sample sizes for a majority of our
        fragrances. This way, you can try before you invest in a full-sized
        bottle.

        How do I track my order? Once your order has been shipped, you will
        receive a tracking number via email. You can use this number on our
        website or with the respective courier service to track your package.
